        <p>The goal of this virtual reality experience is to play soccer and try to score as many goals as you can in a set amount of time, but in order to win you need to score only 5 goals, while avoiding the goal keeper.  This VR experience is very interactive. To move around the soccer pitch, you can use the arrow keys, you can also use the WASD keys to move around. The timer will start as soon as you enter the game. 
          The gameplay is quick and simple, however once the game loads, you must follow these steps.
        <ol>
          <li>Click On The Red Post To Activate The Sounds Of Cheering</li>
          <li>Go Up To The Ball And Move Foward Using Any Key</li>
          <li>Try To Avoid The Goal Keeper, While Also Guiding The Ball Into The Net And Avoding the defenders (blue) </li>
        </ol>
        After completing these steps, you will be able to score a goal and be teleported back to the starting location with the ball. A cheering sound will play as soon as the ball strikes the net. Once you get 5 goals it will state a "You win" message.
